Interpretation of the output 


The output based on summary are pretty random and I don't feel like this output gives me the recommendation I want.
All 50 recommendations have a score of 1, so 100% match. Without a limit of 50 there would probably be A LOT of movies with 90%+.
This is probably the result because in the summary are a lot of words. 
And if we are searching for lexemes of 'fast' and 'furious' we will find them in a lot of movies. 

The output based on the title is just 5 movies. That is because I used fast+furious, 
because I was afraid if I only used 'fast' or 'furious' I would get the same general results as with Summary. 
All the five movies are a direct hit though. But they are all from the same franchise, so doesn't give me
new information. 

The recommendations based on "starring" gave me 18 movies where 'diesel' is found in.
I like Vin Diesel. So I like this output. But again, this can also be generated with a filter in excel.
So good recommendations, but not really new information. 

In the last, python made, recommendation list based on the metascore I find a lot of interesting new movies.
Some I know, some I don't, but the ones I know are to my liking. This recommandation system is the best one. 

I would've liked to have more of an introduction into Python before working with it, but in the end it worked. 

In this week there has been little time to learn alot. I am not well known in the world of programming,
so everything I did was new and I put in A LOT of hours to understand what I am doing and actually doing it. 

In the files I tried to explain as much as I can without making big stories. 

There were no standards written down for the report, so I hope this is sufficient. 

Kind regards,
