# recommendationsystem
Hello!
Hereby a small explanation of the files in this directory
The moviesfrommetacritic.csv is the dataset used to work with for the four top50recommendations.csv outputs
The moviescodeday.sql is a copy-paste of the codes used in the RPI terminal to create the four top50recommendations.sv files
On the basis of the example with pirates of the caribbean, the file top50recommendationsSummaryPirates.csv was made. 
After this I tried to do the same with my own favourite movie, 2 fast 2 furious.
On the basis of the Summary (of the movie), Starring (Actor Vin Diesel from the movie) and Title (of the movie) the other three top50recommendations csv files were created.
