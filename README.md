# recommendationsystem
Hello!
Hereby a small explanation of the files in this directory.

The historyw1 is a list of the commands used this week 

The moviesfrommetacritic.csv is the dataset used to work with for the four top50recommendations.csv outputs.

The moviescodeday1.sql is a copy-paste of the codes used in the RPI terminal to create the four top50recommendations.sv files. This is added as part of the proof of work. 

On the basis of the example with pirates of the caribbean, the file top50recommendationsSummaryPirates.csv was made. 

After this I tried to do the same with my own favourite movie, 2 fast 2 furious.

On the basis of the Summary (of the movie), Starring (Actor Vin Diesel from the movie) and Title (of the movie) the other three top50recommendations csv files were created. The .sql files (cleaned) for all three are also added. 

Also the recommendations made with the python script are posted, based on the metascores. Both .csv and .py are posted.
