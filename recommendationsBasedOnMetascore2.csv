Deepwater Horizon is a film built on courage, the extraordinary cast and most of all, the true events that inspired it and the heroes who counted on hope when times were dire. The visuals were excellent, and the film was very well shot. Mark Wahlberg was excellent, and the rest of the cast did not disappoint either. This is an important film to watch that highlights a disaster that seemed almost too much of a dream to occur. Berg's disaster film left me engulfed in emotion and awe.

XXL is a better movie than I thought it would be, the songs are off the charts, the dancing is great and Channing Tatum gives a hell of a performance. It was sad to see Dallas and The Kid go, and seeing what an amazing performance McConaughey gave in the predecessor, I was bummed, new director, okay cast and Sodenbergh being used as the director of photography. Boy, was I wrong. This movie tops its predecessor in every way, excellent visuals, brilliant acting and groovy music are just some of the highlights. Jada Pinkett Smith was amazing, Amber Heard is in this, Micheal Strahan gave us some magic and many more stars deliver MAGIC. PURE MAGIC. There is more comedy this time, because Magic Mike had a bit more serious tone.

The result is haunting, suspenseful, terrifying and thrilling, every moment was crackling with suspense, an eerie quietness and powerhouse performances and emotions. Wade knows that Maggie will die, but he stays close to her till her last breath. Maggie captures the relationship between a father and her daughter masterfully. It's dark and scary, and meets the requirements of a zombie outbreak and its effect hits home. Maggie deserves a staring ovation. It's brilliantly written, sharply directed, masterfully acted and well executed. Take your father to watch this one, it's a love letter to all fathers in the whole world.

Becuase, the years we yearned for Mad Max, this dude was cooking up some serious entertainment.

The story starts out with Max (Tom Hardy), a former cop, who gets abducted by War Boys, skinny looking minions of Immortan Joe, to be their \""blood bank\"". He ends up being a blood bank for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a brainwashed War Boy. The story entwines with the story of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who involves Max's escape into HER plan to take tortured girls put of Immortan Joe's captivity, to a place where mankind will thrive, the place where she was born. For the rest of the runtime, experiance Joe's minions getting in their way, for a long car chase, that glued me to my seat for some heart pumping, bloody thrills. Acting wise, Hardy makes a good Max, he has the hint that Mel Gibson had  in the previous movies. The real kick is Theron, a fearless warrior, she has a dark past attached to her and the movie adapts to her story in her way as well. Hoult as Nux is not short of its kick as well. Mad Max has come a long way, Miller has crafted a new path for the Mad Max Universe, with some really interesting weird characters and Furiosa's story has more to it. But for what we have now, this is a standalone masterpiece,  easily the best in the series. Fury Road puts all other acrion movies to shame.

This is a movie for film lovers and pop culture enthusiasts. It is a vampire film that takes advantage of its time span; cultural references dating back hundreds of years can be found at every corner. Only Lovers Left Alive does not focus on blood and gore, it is not a thriller nor a horror, it doesn't even truly focus on the world of vampires.

This is a date night Romantic  Comedy that both sides of the relationship will find a lot to like.  It’s almost like a male version of Bridget Jones, but with Salsa dancing.  The dance off scene in the car park makes this a more special movie, although there is some help with special effects to make Frost dance better, you still have to give the man props for being able to move as well as he can for that size.

But now, in 2014, director of Superman Returns- Bryan Singer comes with another level of high class, well acted Xmen, with good results. The first think I want to say is that Days of Future Last isn't your typical action fulled, popcorn movie. If you like the comics or are familier with the characters and storylines, it's good to go for you. Some movies are so gripping and they stay so true to their comics and origins- DOFP is that type of movie. The Xmen send Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman in the past to stop the war that came in the future. Hugh Jackman was really good in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were the highlights. Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry were there but they were normal fare. This is the most absorbing and greatest Xmen movie ever know in recent years, it deserves the hype, and sure as damn deserves this much pride. This is what Tarantino did to Pulp Fiction, what Nolan did to The Dark Knight, what Kubrick did to Clockwork Orange. This is real cinema. I think I have never watched a movie so exciting and refreshing. You walk out of the theatre felling a sense of joy or spotting those Easter eggs with your friends and family.

Not just because it has been the soundtrack of many social movements, but of personal ones, too. Oscar Isaac as Llewyn is revelatory, a bone-tired, supremely talented man whose passion for making music is struggling mightily against the whims of the industry and his demons  one being the loss of his musical partner to suicide. When Isaac sings, we're transported first to the dusky bars of 1960s West Village and, more important, to the jungle of discouragement and confusion he's living in. It's a powerful performance. Supporting him is a great ensemble, some new to the Coen Brothers family (Timberlake, thankfully subdued and nearly holding his own against the others) and some beloved veterans (Goodman). It's not just Isaac and the cast, though, that makes Inside Llewyn Davis remarkable. The music, with T-Bone Burnett in charge of the soundtrack, takes its rightful place front and center. And the Coens tell the story in a clever, elliptical way that drives home the futility and magic of a time. But it's not all sadness and tears.

dallas-buyers-club;10;Thegodfatherson;/user/Thegodfatherson;Nov  1, 2013;"[ ""Though it may be a story of sickness and death, \""Dallas Buyers Club\"" is about the rebirth of a homophobe. Suddenly an outcast among his heterosexual friends, Woodroof reluctantly warms to a new community  particularly a drug-addicted transsexual named Rayon who becomes his business partner. Rayon is played by an earnestly committed Jared Leto who nevertheless comes off as a theatrical drag queen cliche. They run the buyers club together out of a cheap motel, the unlikeliest pair of Bonnie and Clyde renegades yet. Quebec filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee (\""The Young Victoria\"") directs \""Dallas Buyers Club\"" with a loose naturalism, seedy environs and lively humour that prevents the film from becoming over-sentimentalized. It's a true story long in the making (screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) based on Woodroof's remarkable late life. But what \""Dallas Buyers Club\"" is, ultimately, is the apotheosis of another transformation: McConaughey's great U-turn. A few years after sinking into rote romantic comedies, \""Dallas Buyers Club\"" tops an astonishing streak for the 43-year-old that has included \""Mud,\""  Bernie\"". He lost more than 40 pounds for the role (Leto, too, is startlingly thin), and appears so gaunt as to wipe away any memory of his rosier, more superficial performances. Extreme weight loss, too, can be a superficial ploy, but McConaughey inhabits the clamouring, clawing Woodroof, whose zest for life (which McConaughey has always exuded) flourishes with the meaning of a moral cause. He stomps down hospital hallways in cowboy boots, a foul-mouthed champion against the system, spouting obscenities in a Texas drawl. In one late scene that could be either Woodroof or McConaughey, he looks in the mirror, and smiles."" ]";0.0;1.0;0.0;1.0;inf;10

The story envelops rather than unspools, a guttural experience. As Scott stages the confined action, bouncing from location to location like a Pinter play's moving sets, the musical score pulsates with dread. In one scene, a nameless assailant strings a steel wire across a desert road, intending to slice a speeding biker who will eventually appear. That's the movie in one note: taught, prophetic, and hushed. We don't have our finger on why this is happening, but we can feel what's coming. We know it's grisly.

enough-said;10;Thegodfatherson;/user/Thegodfatherson;Sep 20, 2013;"[ ""It’s at this fine-grained observation of human folly that Holofcener excels, without ever abandoning her compassion for her wayward, fumbling characters. A subplot about Eva’s best friend’s inability to fire her housekeeper gestures, a bit too obliquely, at social satire (Holofcener’s last two films, Friends With Money and Please Give, dealt more explicitly with matters of class and social mobility). But I appreciate that this movie doesn’t make us choose between context-based character humor and snappy romantic banter—instead, it provides both in great bounty. Elaine Benes and Tony Soprano may seem an unlikely pairing, but Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini make strangely persuasive bedfellows—in fact, they’re one of the most impossible-not-to-root-for on-screen couples in recent memory. Gandolfini, by all accounts, was a gentle, modest, and sensitive man who felt emotionally depleted by the violent, dark roles he was generally called on to play in the wake of The Sopranos. Here, we get a glimpse of the second career he could have had as a light comedic heartthrob. That it won’t ever come to be is only one of countless reasons to wish Gandolfini were still around."" ]";0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;inf;10

fast-furious-6;10;Thegodfatherson;/user/Thegodfatherson;May 24, 2013;"[ ""Fast and the Furious 6 is mind blowing entertainment. It's official. The title of the sixth film in the Fast and the Furious anthology is, at least here in the states, Furious 6. It's Fast and Furious 6 in foreign markets, but it doesn't take long to realize the Fast part of the title is gone. Furious 6 is never as exhilarating as its most recent predecessor, Fast Five, but it's difficult to keep up with that thrill-a-minute spectacular. Still, lack of pace doesn't keep this entry from being a rock-solid action extravaganza with a few genuine tricks up its sleeve. Furious 6 revs up slow, but just like the franchise's muscle-car-loving muscle head lead, it knows when to hit the nitrous: a bit later in the race. Also cool, very cool indeed, is Furious 6's final 40 minutes. Much of the film plays with the mystery, keeps the good-guy crew constantly trying to get the upper hand on the bad-guy crew, and throws in stylized car chase after stylized car chase. The comedic banter much of Dom's crew throws at one another is typical but keeps the pep always up in the room. It all rides smoothly until those final 40 minutes, when all hell breaks loose, tanks and giant cargo planes included. Lin is a wizard at crafting pulse-pounding, engaging, and highly inventive action pieces. It takes a while for Furious 6 to get to them, but when it does, it's best to be strapped in. The action in Furious 6 energizes the audience, but the story here energizes the bonds of all of these characters. That's needed where Furious 6 ends up, full circle to Tokyo Drift and evidently the end of Lin's run at the steering wheel. His four-film arc has allowed the Fast and the Furious series to transcend beyond the entertainment value of the first film as well as the general laziness of 2 Fast 2 Furious, the second film. These last two films, however, have set the bar extremely high for future directors to take over. At least we know, from Furious 6's post-credit scene, the villain in The Fast and the Furious 7 is going to be a doozy."" ]";0.0;1.0;0.0;1.0;inf;10

42;10;Thegodfatherson;/user/Thegodfatherson;May 16, 2013;"[ ""The Bottom Line"", ""A too self-consciously inspiring rendition of Jackie Robinson's genuinely inspiring accomplishment of breaking baseball's color barrier."", """", ""Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford provide engaging performances as Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey in the Legendary/Warner Bros. drama about the man who broke MLB's color line. Pretty when it should be gritty and grandiosely noble instead of just telling it like it was, 42 needlessly trumps up but still can't entirely spoil one of the great American 20th century true-life stories, the breaking of major league baseball's color line by Jackie Robinson. Whether in the deep South or the streets of Brooklyn, life here looks spiffy and well-scrubbed enough to appear in a department store window, while the soaring musical accompaniment seems to be stamping all the protagonists' passports for immediate admission to that great ballpark in the sky. All the same, lead actors Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford cut through the artifice with engaging performances as Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, respectively, and audiences who don't know much about the first black man to play professional baseball will be suitably impressed. Hit-starved Warner Bros. should be able to stir moderately good attendance domestically, although foreign prospects, as always with baseball yarns, are slight. The key scene in 42, just as it was in the low-budget 1950 The Jackie Robinson Story, which starred the ballplayer himself, comes when Rickey, warning his prospect about the abuse that inevitably awaits him, demands to know if he's “got enough guts not to fight back” when provoked by other players or fans. Robinson was not the best player in the Negro Leagues, but he was reckoned to be the one who might best withstand the trial by fire posed by teammates who didn't want to play with him and a society that often wouldn't allow him to travel, eat or lodge with the rest of the team. Needing a manageable window through which to dramatize a sports breakthrough fraught with racial, social, political and attitudinal meaning, this pet project of writer-director Brian Helgeland and producer Thomas Tull zeroes in on the years 1945-47, concluding with Robinson's first year in the majors. Although there is quick mention of a sports career at UCLA (which, the film does not note, had the most integrated sports program of any school in the U.S. at the time) and a quick temper that earned him an Army court-martial, the 26-year-old member of the American Negro League Kansas City Monarchs seems like the picture of rectitude, a well-spoken young man with a lovely wife-to-be, Rachel (Nicole Beharie), and none of the wild traits of some of his teammates. As one of the last century's most inspiring and literally game-changing personal sagas, Jackie Robinson's life can hardly help but be stirring and will no doubt impress many younger viewers, some of whom may be completely unfamiliar with his story. It's just too bad that Helgeland can't go for broke and get his uniform as dirty as Jackie Robinson used to do."" ]";2.0;5.0;2.0;3.0;inf;10
